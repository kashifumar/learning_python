# Learning Python Basics
Python Library for Basic Learning. The purpose of this repo is to learn teh basics of Python programming. I'll be using Docker to run teh code. So that means no Python or package installations. All we need is Docker. You can check this repor [Docker Learning](https://github.com/kashifumar/learning_docker) to install Docker. There are links in teh repo if you would like to learn more of Docker. For now, all you need to know is that Docker wil help us from running any code from our system without worrying about the OS and needing any installations in our system to get working.
