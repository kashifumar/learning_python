# This is a simple Python program that performs a mathematical operation and 
# displays the result.

# python3 code/01_basics/00.py
print(5+6)

# print(10 + 20)  # Output: 30
# print(3 + 7)    # Output: 10


# print() Function:
#    In Python, the print() function is used to display output on the screen.
#     Whatever is inside the parentheses () will be shown when you run the program.


# 5 + 6 (Mathematical Operation):
#    The + symbol is used for addition.
#    5 + 6 means we are adding the number 5 to the number 6.


# Final Output:
#    When the program runs, it calculates 5 + 6, which equals 11.
#    The print() function then displays the result.


# Key Takeaways for a First-Time Coder
# ✅ print() is used to show output.
# ✅ + is an arithmetic operator for addition.
