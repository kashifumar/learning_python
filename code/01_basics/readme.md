# Simple Python Program: Basic Arithmetic Operation

## Description
This is a simple Python program that performs a mathematical operation and displays the result.

## Usage
Run the following command in the terminal to execute the program:

```bash
python3 code/01_basics/00.py
```

## Code Example
```python
print(5 + 6)
```

### Example Outputs
```python
print(10 + 20)  # Output: 30
print(3 + 7)    # Output: 10
```

## Explanation
- **`print()` Function**: Displays output on the screen. Whatever is inside the parentheses `()` will be printed.
- **Mathematical Operation (`5 + 6`)**:
  - `+` is the addition operator.
  - `5 + 6` adds two numbers together.
- **Final Output**: The program calculates `5 + 6`, which equals `11`, and prints the result.

## Key Takeaways for Beginners
✅ `print()` is used to show output.
✅ `+` is an arithmetic operator for addition.
✅ Python automatically calculates the result before printing.
✅ This program demonstrates basic arithmetic in Python.
